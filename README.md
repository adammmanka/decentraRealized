# HEPL

#Vision: To help scale on-chain inclusion by creating a decentralized application containing full-time and contract placement positions in the crypto economy.

#The idea is to create a protocol where those placing job advertisements will interact with the Ethereum blockchain by paying for gas to store their position in IPFS which will in turn be published as a hash on the main chain.

#Existing job boards can then subscribe to this, pulling from the hashes stored on the main chain to display the files of job listing that are currently being stored in IPFS.

#forked from:

# Simple Ethereum + InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)+ React.js DApp

#A simple DApp to upload a document to IPFS and then store the IPFS hash on the Ethereum blockchain. Once the IPFS hash number is sent to the Ethereum blockchain, the user will receive a transaction receipt. We will use Create-React-App framework to make a front-end. This Dapp works with any user that has MetaMask installed in their browser.
