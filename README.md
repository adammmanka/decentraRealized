# DecentraRealized
# Scale on-chain inclusion and diversity

# Decentralized application running on the Ethereum blockchain. 

# Using the Embark platform, decentraRealized will facilitate the posting of full-time and contract placement of open positions within the cryptoeconomy as hashes on the Ethereum blockchain. The files will be stored in IPFS.

# Companies looking to post jobs on the decentraRealized dApp will upload the desired file and send a transaction. They will receive a receipt for the creation of the hash. 

# a gas estimater is needed to faciliate the estimate of the gas it will cost to store file in IPFS as a hash for desired time period. 

# Any existing job board can "subscribe" to decentraRealized to pull from all hashes to receive an output of all files that are currently being stored in IPFS
